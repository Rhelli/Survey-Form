# Survey-Form Project

Short, simple project to create a questionaire/survey form. Allows the user to input the following information:
  - First name 
  - Last name
  - Birthdate
  - Numerical input
  - Radio and checkbox buttons for selection
  - Dropdown lists for selection
  
Also includes:
  - Navbar with dropdown menus
  - 3D semi-animated 'submit' button (NB. not actual animation using @animation // @keyframes but using CSS :hover and :active     states)
  - Pirate theme and far too much pirate themed language
  - Responsiveness for devices under 480px wide

    Post Dev SWOT
    
    Strenghts
      - Navbar and the navbar :hover element, will be using that again.
      - 3D submit button - In lieu of using actual @animations and @keyframes, it provides a very simple, pure CSS solution to         a more interactive 'submit' button
      - Responsiveness appears to work as intended
      
     Weaknesses
      - Radio and checkboxes - had some difficulty in aligning the labels for them properly
    
    Opportunities
      - Animating some elements such as the navbar and the submit button using @animation and @keyframes could provide a more         pleasant user experience
      - Could build upon the better use of design applied in this project from the last (Tribute page)
